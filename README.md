# KeepingBusinessesAfloat
This is an analysis of the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the government to aid businesses in response to the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. The analysis used an 11 million record dataset from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and involved data preparation, cleaning, and transformation using Excel, SQL, and Python tools. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations were carried out using Tableau and insights were presented in PowerPoint. The research question was whether the program was effective in reaching small businesses and businesses in underserved areas. The analysis revealed that the program performed well in reaching smaller businesses, with small loans having greater coverage than large loans (99.7% vs. 77%). Furthermore, from 2020 to 2021 there was an increase in the proportion of loans issued to businesses in underserved areas, as well as those with low to moderate income. And contrary to expectations, the total number of businesses increased post-pandemic, possibly indicating that the aid received helped prevent a more severe crisis.
